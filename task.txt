*** develop only in trading software ***
Hi, I have great interest in your project.
I am a professional trading software developer with more than 10years experience.
I have good skills to build strategy with tradingview's pinescript or mql4 of metatrader, but also I have good experience to build with broker's native apis.
I am familiar with Forex and stock, cryptocurrency financial market.

if you have clear idea to build strategy, i can deliver good result and will support all times.

Can we discuss more detail ?

Thank you.
